Tkinter Multi-Threading:
========================

Tkinter isn't a thread safe module for python, so you may find that even if you do get 
the programming running without errors, it randomly fails to respond and completely 
crashes at random points throughout the program. Any Tkinter related calls that get 
made make sure they are made in the main thread with the exception of root.after(). 
I would suggest doing all your processing in separate threads, and then when using Tkinter 
call methods you want via the after method with a delay of 1, which will ensure no random 
crashes. This wont fix your current issues, but it will fix ones later.
